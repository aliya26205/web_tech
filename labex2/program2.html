      Then took the other, as just as fair<br>
      And having perhaps the better claim,<br>
      Because it was grassy and wanted wear;<br>
      Though as for that the passing there<br>
      Had worn them really about the same.

    <p>
      And both that morning equally lay<br>
      In leaves no step had trodden black.<br>
      Oh, I kept the first for another day!<br>
      Yet knowing how way leads on to way,<br>
      I doubted if I should ever come back.
    </p>

      I shall be telling this with a sigh<br>
      Somewhere ages and ages hence:<br>
      Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—<br>
      I took the one less traveled by,<br>
      And that has made all the difference.
